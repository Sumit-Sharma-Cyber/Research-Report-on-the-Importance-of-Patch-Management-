## ⚠️ Risks of Unpatched Systems
Unpatched or outdated systems are among the **most common causes of cybersecurity breaches**.  
When organizations delay updates, they expose themselves to serious threats such as:

1. **Increased Vulnerability to Exploits**  
   Attackers actively scan for known vulnerabilities in outdated software and exploit them to gain unauthorized access.

2. **Data Breaches and Information Theft**  
   Sensitive customer or business data can be stolen through unpatched weaknesses.

3. **Malware and Ransomware Infections**  
   Many ransomware attacks, including **WannaCry (2017)**, exploited unpatched Windows systems.

4. **Financial and Reputational Damage**  
   Breaches due to poor patch management can result in loss of trust, revenue, and legal penalties.

5. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**  
   Many cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS) require timely patching as part of compliance.
